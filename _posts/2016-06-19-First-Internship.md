## Internships

Here I share my experience of the first internship

An internship gives you a hands-on chance to apply the education and knowledge you gained, it also helps you strengthen your professional skills. Transferable skills like communication, teamwork, professional etiquette and work ethic can usually only be developed through actual experience. An internship is the best way to immerse yourself in the culture and gain relevant skills.

### “An expert in anything was once a beginner ”

With this thought i started my first internship at **robocop.io**. Robocop help companies develop, deploy, maintain and monitor their cloud infrastructure for any cloud provider. The term “cloud computing” feared me as I had never worked on it.

### Internship at Robocop.io
I still remember my first day when introduction about the product and work was given to all interns.The nervousness and fear by the trailer on that day reached to the peak and I started to question myself if I could do it. But the determination to learn something new was enough to overcome the inconfidence.

You need to know what you want to achieve from an internship so you can challenge yourself and the employer to make sure you have a worthwhile experience. I decided to do an internship because I needed the chance to apply my skills in the workplace and sample working life for the first time. Looking back certain factors ensured the internship worked for me, so here are some of the insights I learned.

1. New/improved skills
  + I learned about cloud computing and cloud technologies, deploying, professional coding techniques. During the internship my skills of web development, algorithms and databases were sharpened.
2. A more complete (and impressive) resume
3. A greater sense of professionalism
4. More confidence in my career direction
5. Teamwork
  + Working together on the project with other interns is fun and also gives opportunities of more knowledge.

One may also face criticisms during the journey, You might not enjoy the criticism, but it should help you polish your skills before you dive into your career.
In short,I have started to gain a good insight of how the industry works. The experience was the most beneficial part about my internship.

I am now looking forward to get more industrial experience and am willing not to miss any chance of internships opportunities I get, like one in robocop.
