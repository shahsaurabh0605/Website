# Website

A Simple, Bootstrap Based Website to show projects and to take notes. There are also some magical features to discover.

## Notable Features

* Based on Bootstrap
* [Github Module](http://aaskashah.me/open-source) to show your popular projects in a single page and on sidebar automatically. (Datas are retreived by github metadata instead of by api calls, so no delay)
* [Post Module](http://aaskashah.me/blog) to show all your posts with timeline
* [Bookmark Module](http://aaskashah.me/bookmark) to establish a quick mark about all libs/tools/books you like to use.
* [Post Navigation Module](http://aaskashah.me/css/2016/04/22/CSS-Animation.html) to generate a quick directory of your post by titles/subtitles automatically.
